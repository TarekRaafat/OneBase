Section 6: Data Persistence and Exporting

In this section, we will explore how Skalex provides data persistence and exporting capabilities. We'll learn how to automatically save and load data, export filtered collection data to CSV, and backup and restore Skalex databases. Let's dive in!

6.1 Automatic Data Saving and Loading
Skalex allows you to automatically save and load your database to and from the local storage. This ensures that your data is persisted across sessions. Here's how you can enable automatic data saving and loading:

```javascript
// Enable automatic data saving
skalex.enableAutoSave();

// Disable automatic data saving
skalex.disableAutoSave();

// Load the database from local storage
skalex.loadDatabase();
```

6.2 Exporting Filtered Collection Data to CSV
Skalex provides a convenient method to export filtered data from a collection to a CSV file. This is useful when you need to extract specific data for analysis or sharing. Here's an example of how you can export data to CSV:

```javascript
// Export filtered data from a collection to CSV
const collectionName = "users";
const filter = { age: { $gt: 25 } }; // Filter users older than 25

skalex.exportToCSV(collectionName, filter, "users_over_25.csv");
```

This code exports all users older than 25 from the "users" collection to a CSV file named "users_over_25.csv".

6.3 Backing Up and Restoring Skalex Databases
Skalex allows you to create backups of your database and restore them when needed. This can be handy in case of accidental data loss or when migrating to a new environment. Here's how you can create backups and restore them:

```javascript
// Create a backup of the Skalex database
skalex.createBackup("backup1");

// Restore a Skalex database from a backup
skalex.restoreFromBackup("backup1");
```

In the above code, we create a backup named "backup1" of the Skalex database and later restore it if needed.

Note: Skalex supports multiple backups, allowing you to create and restore from different points in time.

Conclusion:
In this section, we explored the data persistence and exporting features of the Skalex JavaScript Database Library. We learned how to enable automatic data saving and loading, export filtered collection data to CSV, and create backups and restore databases. These features ensure that your data is safely stored, easily accessible, and can be shared or analyzed as needed. With Skalex, you have the tools to manage your data effectively.
