Section 8: Examples and Use Cases

In this section, we will explore practical examples and use cases to demonstrate the capabilities of the Skalex JavaScript Database Library. Each example will be accompanied by code snippets to help you understand how to implement these features in your own projects.

Example 1: Building a Simple Task Manager Application

Let's imagine we want to create a task manager application using Skalex. We'll have a collection called "tasks" that stores information about each task, including its title, description, and status.

```javascript
// Creating a new Skalex database
const db = new SkalexDB("myAppDB");

// Creating a tasks collection
const tasksCollection = db.createCollection("tasks");

// Adding a new task
const newTask = {
  title: "Complete Skalex tutorial",
  description: "Finish writing the Skalex tutorial and submit it.",
  status: "In Progress",
};
tasksCollection.insert(newTask);

// Querying tasks
const allTasks = tasksCollection.find();
console.log(allTasks);

// Updating a task
const taskToUpdate = tasksCollection.findOne({
  title: "Complete Skalex tutorial",
});
taskToUpdate.status = "Completed";
tasksCollection.update(taskToUpdate);

// Deleting a task
const taskToDelete = tasksCollection.findOne({
  title: "Complete Skalex tutorial",
});
tasksCollection.remove(taskToDelete);
```

Example 2: Implementing a Blog with Interconnected Data

Let's say we want to create a blog using Skalex. We'll have two collections: "posts" to store blog posts and "comments" to store comments related to each post. Each post will have a unique ID and can have multiple comments associated with it.

```javascript
// Creating a new Skalex database
const db = new SkalexDB("myBlogDB");

// Creating a posts collection
const postsCollection = db.createCollection("posts");

// Creating a comments collection
const commentsCollection = db.createCollection("comments");

// Adding a new post
const newPost = {
  title: "Introduction to Skalex",
  content: "Learn how to use the Skalex JavaScript database library.",
};
const insertedPost = postsCollection.insert(newPost);

// Adding comments to a post
const comment1 = {
  postId: insertedPost._id,
  text: "Great tutorial! I learned a lot.",
};
const comment2 = {
  postId: insertedPost._id,
  text: "Thank you for sharing this valuable information.",
};
commentsCollection.insert(comment1);
commentsCollection.insert(comment2);

// Retrieving post with comments
const postWithComments = postsCollection.findOne({ _id: insertedPost._id });
const relatedComments = commentsCollection.find({ postId: insertedPost._id });
console.log(postWithComments);
console.log(relatedComments);
```

These examples provide a glimpse into how you can leverage Skalex to build various applications. By utilizing the collection management, querying, and relationship features, you can create powerful and interconnected data structures for your projects.

Feel free to explore and experiment with Skalex in your own applications, tailoring it to your specific needs and requirements. The possibilities are endless!
