Section 5: Advanced Querying with Skalex

Skalex provides advanced querying capabilities to help you filter, sort, and paginate your data efficiently. In this section, we'll explore the various query operators, sorting options, and how to leverage indexes for optimized performance.

5.1 Using Query Operators for Complex Filtering
Skalex allows you to perform complex filtering operations using query operators. Here are some examples:

```javascript
// Find documents where the "age" field is greater than 25
const result1 = skalex.collection("users").find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });

// Find documents where the "name" field starts with "J" and the "age" field is less than or equal to 30
const result2 = skalex
  .collection("users")
  .find({ name: { $regex: "^J" }, age: { $lte: 30 } });

// Find documents where the "status" field is either "active" or "inactive"
const result3 = skalex
  .collection("users")
  .find({ status: { $in: ["active", "inactive"] } });
```

5.2 Sorting and Pagination of Query Results
Skalex allows you to sort query results based on one or more fields. You can also paginate through the results using the `limit` and `skip` options. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Sort documents in ascending order of the "name" field and retrieve the first 10 documents
const result = skalex.collection("users").find().sort("name").limit(10);

// Sort documents in descending order of the "age" field and retrieve the second page (documents 11-20)
const result = skalex
  .collection("users")
  .find()
  .sort({ age: -1 })
  .skip(10)
  .limit(10);
```

5.3 Leveraging Indexes for Optimized Performance
Skalex allows you to create indexes on one or more fields to improve the performance of your queries. Here's an example of creating an index:

```javascript
// Create an index on the "name" field
skalex.collection("users").createIndex("name");
```

After creating an index, Skalex will utilize it to speed up queries that involve the indexed field. This can significantly improve the performance of your database operations.

Conclusion:
With Skalex's advanced querying features, you can perform complex filtering, sort query results, and optimize performance using indexes. These capabilities empower you to efficiently retrieve the data you need from your Skalex database, making your application faster and more responsive. Experiment with the provided code examples and explore the full potential of Skalex's querying capabilities.
