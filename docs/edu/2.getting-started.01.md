2. Getting Started with Skalex

In this section, we will walk you through the steps to get started with Skalex in your JavaScript projects. We will cover the installation and setup process, basic configuration options, and creating your first Skalex database.

2.1 Installation and Setup

To begin using Skalex, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Skalex via npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install skalex
```

Step 2: Once the installation is complete, you can import Skalex into your JavaScript file using the `require` or `import` statement, depending on your project setup:

```javascript
// Using CommonJS
const Skalex = require("skalex");

// Using ES6 modules
import Skalex from "skalex";
```

2.2 Basic Configuration Options

Skalex provides some basic configuration options to tailor the library to your specific needs. You can configure the following options before creating a Skalex database:

- **`autoSave`**: Sets whether the database should automatically save changes to disk. By default, it is enabled (`true`).
- **`autoLoad`**: Sets whether the database should automatically load data from disk on initialization. By default, it is enabled (`true`).
- **`dataPath`**: Specifies the path where the database files should be stored. By default, it is set to the current working directory.

Here's an example of configuring Skalex with custom options:

```javascript
const skalexOptions = {
  autoSave: true,
  autoLoad: true,
  dataPath: "/path/to/database/files",
};

const skalex = new Skalex(skalexOptions);
```

2.3 Creating Your First Skalex Database

Now, let's create your first Skalex database and perform basic operations on it:

```javascript
// Create a new Skalex database
const db = skalex.createDatabase("mydb");

// Create a collection within the database
const users = db.createCollection("users");

// Insert documents into the collection
users.insert({ name: "John Doe", age: 25 });
users.insert({ name: "Jane Smith", age: 32 });
users.insert({ name: "Mark Johnson", age: 40 });

// Find all documents in the collection
const allUsers = users.find();
console.log(allUsers);

// Find documents matching a specific condition
const filteredUsers = users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } });
console.log(filteredUsers);

// Update a document
users.update({ name: "John Doe" }, { age: 26 });

// Delete a document
users.remove({ name: "Mark Johnson" });
```

In the above example, we create a Skalex database named 'mydb' and a collection named 'users'. We then insert some documents into the collection, retrieve all documents, filter documents based on a condition, update a document, and delete a document.

By following these steps, you are now ready to start utilizing Skalex and harness its power to simplify database management in your JavaScript projects.
