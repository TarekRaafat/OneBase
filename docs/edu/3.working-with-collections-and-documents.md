Section 3: Working with Collections and Documents

In this section, we will explore how to work with collections and documents using the Skalex JavaScript database library. We'll cover the basics of collection structure, creating and managing collections, and performing operations on individual documents.

3.1 Understanding the Collection Structure
In Skalex, a collection is a container for storing related documents. Each collection can have multiple documents, and each document consists of key-value pairs. The key acts as the identifier for the document, and the value can be any valid JavaScript object.

Example:

```javascript
// Creating a collection named 'users'
const usersCollection = skalex.createCollection("users");
```

3.2 Creating and Managing Collections
To create a collection using Skalex, you can use the `createCollection` method, as shown in the previous example. Skalex provides methods to add, update, and delete documents within a collection.

Example:

```javascript
// Adding a document to the 'users' collection
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
};

usersCollection.addDocument(user);

// Updating a document in the 'users' collection
user.age = 26;
usersCollection.updateDocument(user);

// Deleting a document from the 'users' collection
usersCollection.deleteDocument(user.id);
```

3.3 Retrieving and Querying Data from Collections
Skalex provides various methods to retrieve and query data from collections. You can retrieve all documents within a collection, get a specific document by its key, or perform complex queries using filters.

Example:

```javascript
// Retrieving all documents from the 'users' collection
const allUsers = usersCollection.getAllDocuments();
console.log(allUsers);

// Getting a specific user by key
const specificUser = usersCollection.getDocumentByKey(1);
console.log(specificUser);

// Querying users based on a specific condition
const filteredUsers = usersCollection.queryDocuments(
  (user) => user.age > 20 && user.age < 30
);
console.log(filteredUsers);
```

In the above example, the `queryDocuments` method takes a filter function as an argument, which allows you to define your custom filtering logic.

These are just a few basic operations you can perform with collections and documents using the Skalex JavaScript database library. Skalex provides many more features and methods to handle complex database operations, enabling you to efficiently manage and manipulate your data.

Next, we will explore how to utilize relationships in Skalex to establish connections between collections.
